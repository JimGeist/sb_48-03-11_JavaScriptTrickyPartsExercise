## Part 1: JavaScript Trivia

Read through the questions in this list of [JavaScript interview questions](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/interview-questions). Answers are provided, but try to answer the questions on your own first.

I went through the questions and started to write down my answer and I stopped at the palindrome question. These questions, at the time I went over them, just put me in a bad state of mind and reminded be as to why I never got involved in JavaScript to begin with -- because of all the stupid esoteric corner cases to throw in the face of an aspiring developer -- with a smattering of wow, almost a year of this and you cannot answer these questions. It put me in a bad place regarding this course, Springboard, and Colt Steele. I guess that happens when you start an assignment after a subunit to find that there are still ZERO Software Engineering Success Stories that come up when a video ends -- plenty of UI, UX, and Cyber Security, but not a single software engineering success story.  

These are questions that I will review and do my best to understand them.
